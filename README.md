# Customer-Churn
**Overview**

This project predicts customer churn using a Kaggle dataset. It involves preprocessing the data, visualizing trends, and applying various machine learning models to evaluate their performance. The objective is to identify customers likely to churn, enabling proactive strategies to retain them.

**Features**

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values.

Converted categorical variables into numeric formats.

Data Visualization: Explored the dataset to identify key trends and patterns.

Model Training:
Applied various machine learning models, including (list models used, e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.).
Compared model performance using accuracy and confusion matrices.


Evaluation: Highlighted the best-performing model based on predictive accuracy and other metrics.


Dataset



Description: A dataset containing customer demographics, usage statistics, and subscription details.

Results
Model comparison based on:
Accuracy: (e.g., Logistic Regression: 85%, Random Forest: 90%)
Confusion Matrices: (Briefly describe findings or include a sample visualization).
Insights from data visualization:
(Summarize any key observations, e.g., customers with X attribute are more likely to churn).
Requirements
